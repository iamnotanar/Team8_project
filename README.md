Anar Aliyev, Parviz Babazada Final Project for Programming Principles 2
We have concluded Team Project for PP2 at 19:36 on 13th January 2022. There were several challanges with the code at first. For example it was reading the data but not printing it. Our first problem was to correct that. Trhough the project there were several problems Parviz handled like a scanner problem with the search function. And other problems like sorting the data according to ASC and DESC order and many more Anar handled. However we put all our efford we could not figure out the 5 th part filter part for strings and numbers but we were able to successufly run the "date" filter. It was a good juorney to share together.
